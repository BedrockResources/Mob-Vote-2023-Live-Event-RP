## oaklogue
ol.ijgeddgaa=I'm Tiny Agnes! Help us decide which mob will get to join Minecraft. It's hard to decide. I hope I can help you choose by telling you more about them. Which mob do you want to learn more about?
ol.cgijejahgj=Crab?
ol.cdjigaidaj=Penguin?
ol.cabcijfidg=Armadillo?
ol.caijehejee=Exit
ol.dfefffbbaj=The Crab is one of the new mobs that wants to join Minecraft! It lives in Mangrove Swamps. Crab Claws are very helpful for players who enjoy building- they allow blocks to be placed further away.
ol.bjgcbjhacb=The Penguin is one of the new mobs that wants to join Minecraft! It lives in the Stony Shore biome. They're super friendly, so don't be scared if they come up to say hello! They're a bit clumsy on land, but in water, they'll even make your boat move quicker!
ol.ggiahfeaa=The Armadillo is one of the mobs that wants to join Minecraft! It lives in warm places, like Savannahs. The Armadillo drops scute which can be used to craft armor for your wolf. This'll give your favorite four-legged friend some extra defense against hostile mobs!
ol.cbgeaedbg=I'm Tiny Agnes! Voting has already closed, you can't vote anymore, but I will happily tell you more about the mobs!
ol.djibgafcid=Welcome to Whack-a-Mob! Whack as many mobs as you can before the time runs out! But don't hurt the villagers, that would be very bad!
ol.eaafdhhahb=Play Whack a Mob
ol.degejgaabi=Welcome to our home, do you like what we did with the place? We used to have this cool collection of mobs but somehow they all escaped! Can you help us find the lost mobs? They're probably hidden all over the islands... in fact, I think there might be one nearby...
ol.bedjchbic=Oh my god they're back! My babies are back! Thank you so much, here's a little something for all of your hardwork.
ol.bhdgaabidf=Ready to party? Stand on the safe blocks to avoid falling into the lava. Is the lava real? Of course not, don't worry about it!
ol.bebdfjijhc=Play Mob Party
ol.ddcfihcgfb=Hey there! Wanna play Mob Drop? I'll fire you up to the top of the dropper, and then your job is to get to the bottom as fast as possible!
ol.cgchbeieef=Play Mob Drop
ol.cfcidaahgc=We set up these parkour courses, can you jump your way to the top of the statues? The Crab is easy, the Armadillo is medium, and the Penguin is hard!
ol.bgdeiibaaf=This parkour is a little tricky... make sure to pay attention to the jumps ahead!!
ol.degejigjgh=Hi there! I see you've made it to the top of the hill. Soak in the view from up here! Have you checked out that Jungle Temple yet? Tiny Vu said he was going to take a peep. I much prefer sunny hilltops than dusty old ruins, though!
ol.ghiaidgeh=Slow and steady... this parkour course is terrifying! Using sprint and sneak will help a lot....
ol.bjeifajefe=I'm Tiny Agnes! This year's Mob Vote went great! The %s won, can you believe it?! I can still tell you more about each mob...
ol.dfbddiidhe=Ready to vote? All you have to do is hit the lever for your favorite mob! You can change your mind at any time up until the vote closes, but be sure to make up your mind before voting closes! Voting ends at 10:15 AM PST on October 15th.
ol.bhcafifgg=When is that in my timezone?
ol.cjjdhfihce=After the vote?
ol.bbhicagdda=People vote all around the world!

ol.cbgegfhjeb=Sydney Australia Time: 3:15AM, Oct 16th
ol.ecjaijgeca=Once everyone has voted, and we announce the winning mob, it will go into development and eventually be put into the game! Mojang will work hard to fill in the details and implement the winning mob.
ol.baghjeefg=Voting ends when?
ol.ccdgbcehd=This year's Mob Vote is over! I deactivated the levers so you can't vote anymore. Feel free to stick around and explore the rest of the island!
ol.ccedgghdcg=The winning mob will be put into the game! Mojang will work hard to fill in the details and implement the winning mob.
ol.bjbffgcjib=I've been searching for those lost mobs but I've not been having much luck!
ol.cddaadhcgj=Next
ol.cifcebicbb=Tiny Agnes says that they've been spotted all over the islands, although some are still hiding in the house? Maybe that would explains the spooky sounds I've been hearing! I just thought we were being haunted...
ol.cacdihgjh=Ahoy there, traveler! We've uncovered some long-forgotten temple! I wonder what awaits within...
ol.ecddhiajjj=We did it! Let's split the treasure and not tell the others about this... ok?
ol.dghfggfddd=Oh hi there. It seems as though we have stumbled upon some sort of mysterious structure. It looks like it has multiple entrances... I wonder where they lead?
ol.icidfajai=Hooray! We made it to the middle of the maze! That was amazing! Take these Emerald Tickets, you can spend them at one of the shops.
ol.iiehchbgh=Hello! You made it up that cliff too? And you found a Lost Mob on your way up here?! That's fantastic! Agnes has been looking for those mobs! See the boat docked at the port down there? Speak to Lydia and she'll take you out to the Adventure Isles! The mobs escaped from somewhere over there.
ol.bgafffhhea=This house seems a lot bigger than I remember it being. Maybe the others kept expanding it? It looks like, were you to squeeze between all this clutter, there's a path back there...
ol.dgjhbadfc=What do you think of our secret hideout?
